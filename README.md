- 講座のdescription(https://schedules.ire.org/nicar-2023#2285)
>This class will be a hands-on walkthrough of the methods used by Milligan to make the map files that power live, interactive election results maps, inspired heavily by Mike Bostock's Command-Line Cartography Series. (bit.ly/cli-carto)
>
>We'll dig into some popular JSON-based map formats, ways to convert between them, and, ultimately, how to bend them to your will. By the end we'll be able to take a Census shapefile, extract from it exactly what we need, project it, and turn it into either a static image or a TopoJSON ready for your interactive web app. And we'll do it all from the command line using open-source tools, so you can wrap it up in a script and run it again and again!
>
>This session would be good for people with some command-line experience who are comfortable getting knee-deep in some JSON.
